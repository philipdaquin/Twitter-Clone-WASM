# Real Time Blogging Platform on Rust/ WASM 

## Motivation 
To build a scalable, real-time blog platform powered by Apollo Federation, Web assembly, Kafka and Rust.
The project is fully built in Rust from End to End and it implements decoupled services such as User Management, Posts Service and Comments Service.
